### Project description

Formula One Analysis based on Races from 1950 - 2023

The goal was to use SAP SAC to visualize information found in the Formula One Dataset (provided under Data Sources).
We needed to design a Dashboard and a story to inspect, transform and visualize the data.

*The results can be found in the [presentation](https://github.com/NicoHenzel/DataWarehouseWorkshop/blob/main/Pr%C3%A4sentation_Gruppe02.pptx)
